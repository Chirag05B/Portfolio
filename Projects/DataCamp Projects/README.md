 # About the track
 Through this track, I've gained essential Natural Language Processing (NLP) skills, empowering me to turn unstructured data into valuable insights. I've learned to harness NLP in Python for diverse tasks, such as automatically transcribing TED talks, extracting information from articles, and sentiment analysis in movie reviews. Along the way, I've become proficient in key Python NLP libraries like NLTK, scikit-learn, spaCy, and SpeechRecognition.

 ### What I learned
 - I've acquired the skills to harness the power of NLP in Python. This means I can now process unstructured data like TED talks and articles, extracting valuable information automatically. 
- I've delved into sentiment analysis, enabling me to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative. Plus, I've built my very own chatbot that can understand and respond to human language.
- I've become proficient in popular NLP libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, spaCy, and SpeechRecognition, making me well-equipped to work with text data. 
- I've learned how to transcribe audio files using NLP techniques and extract insights from various real-world sources like Wikipedia articles, online reviews, and even data from a flight booking system. These skills open doors to a wide range of practical applications.
