 # About the specialization
   In Generative AI with Large Language Models (LLMs), I learned the fundamentals of how generative AI works, and how to deploy it in real-world applications.
 ### What I learned
 - Gained foundational knowledge, practical skills, and a functional understanding of how generative AI works
- Dove into the latest research on Gen AI to understand how companies are creating value with cutting-edge technology
- Instructed by expert AWS AI practitioners who actively build and deploy AI in business use cases today
