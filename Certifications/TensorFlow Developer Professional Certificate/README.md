 # About the specialization
 TensorFlow is one of the most in-demand and popular open-source deep learning frameworks available today. The DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program teaches you applied machine learning skills with TensorFlow so you can build and train powerful models.

 ### What I learned
 - Best practices for TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework to train a neural network for computer vision applications.  
- Handle real-world image data and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout. 
- Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.  
- Apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs as you train them using text repositories.
