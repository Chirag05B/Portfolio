This is all my notebooks, lab solutions, and assignments for the Stanford University|DeepLearning.AI Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera.

[![Welcome](https://github.com/Chirag05B/Portfolio/blob/main/Certifications/Machine%20Learning%20(2022)/Coursera%20MLS%20-%20Specialization_page-0001.jpg)](https://coursera.org/verify/specialization/MG537NDARRRP)

 
 
 # About the specialization
 This Specialization is taught by Andrew Ng, an AI visionary who has led critical research at Stanford University and groundbreaking work at Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing.AI to advance the AI field.

 ### What I learned
 - Build ML models with NumPy & scikit-learn, build & train supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression)
- Build & train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, & build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods 
- Apply best practices for ML development & use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering & anomaly detection   
- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach & a content-based deep learning method & build a deep reinforcement learning model
