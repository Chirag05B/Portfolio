# [DeepLearning.AI-Practical-Data-Science-on-the-AWS-Cloud]([https://coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/practical-data-science))
This is all my notebooks, lab solutions, and assignments for the DeepLearning.AI Practical Data Science on the AWS Cloud Specialization on Coursera.

[![Welcome](https://github.com/Chirag05B/Portfolio/blob/main/Certifications/Practical%20Data%20Science%20on%20the%20AWS%20Cloud/Practical%20Data%20Science%20on%20the%20AWS%20Cloud_page-0001.jpg)](https://coursera.org/verify/specialization/MZ7VQH4TYN9J)

 
 
 # About the specialization
 This Specialization is designed for data-focused developers, scientists, and analysts familiar with the Python and SQL programming languages who want to learn how to build, train, and deploy scalable, end-to-end ML pipelines - both automated and human-in-the-loop - in the AWS cloud.

 ### What I learned
 - Prepare data, detect statistical data biases, perform feature engineering at scale to train models, & train, evaluate, & tune models with AutoML
- Store & manage ML features using a feature store, & debug, profile, tune, & evaluate models while tracking data lineage and model artifacts
- Build, deploy, monitor, & operationalize end-to-end machine learning pipelines 
- Build data labeling and human-in-the-loop pipelines to improve model performance with human intelligence
