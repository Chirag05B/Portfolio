 # About the specialization
 The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that helped me understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepared me to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology.

 ### What I learned
 - Build and train deep neural networks, identify key architecture parameters, implement vectorized neural networks and deep learning to applications 
- Train test sets, analyze variance for DL applications, use standard techniques and optimization algorithms, and build neural networks in TensorFlow
- Build a CNN and apply it to detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, and apply algorithms to image and video data  
- Build and train RNNs, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer models to perform NER and Question-Answering
