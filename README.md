# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm passionate about leveraging the power of Machine Learning to solve real-world problems. This repository serves as an introduction to my work in the field of Machine Learning.

As I set my sights on a rewarding career, my goal is to contribute my expertise to cutting-edge Machine Learning and NLP projects in a professional setting. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals and organizations, driving innovation and making a meaningful impact in the AI landscape.

## Projects

### Deploying Machine Learning API

- **Project:** IMAGE GENERATION API WITH FASTAPI
- **Description:** Developed an ML Image Generation API with FastAPI, seamlessly integrating a pre-trained model for stable diffusion, and implementing dynamic API endpoints for prompt-based image generation with automatic validation and documentation.
- **Repository:** [Image generation API with FastAPI Project Repository](https://github.com/Chirag05B/Portfolio/tree/main/Projects/ML%20Model%20Deployment/FastAPI/ML%20Web%20Application%20using%20FastAPI)

### Text Summarization

- **Project:** PARAMETER-EFFICIENT FINE-TUNING FOR TEXT SUMMARIZATION WITH LORA
- **Description:** Executed full fine-tuning on an AWS SageMaker Flan-T5 language model for text summarization, utilizing specific prompts to enhance ROUGE scores. Implemented Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA, reducing model size and resources while maintaining quality, and conducted a comparative analysis of full fine-tuned and PEFT models using ROUGE metrics, showcasing resource-saving advantages.

### Object Detection

- **Project:** CAR DETECTION USING YOLO ALGORITHM
- **Description:** Implemented car detection with the YOLO algorithm and TensorFlow in Python, utilizing the YOLOv2 model with pre-trained weights, improving accuracy through non-max suppression (NMS) and intersection over union calculations, and generating bounding box tensors for practical object detection applications.
- **Repository:** [Car detection using YOLO algorithm Project Repository]
