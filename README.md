# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm passionate about leveraging the power of Machine Learning to solve real-world problems. This repository serves as an introduction to my work in the field of Machine Learning. You can find all my projects [here](https://github.com/Chirag05B/Portfolio/tree/main/Projects).

As I set my sights on a rewarding career, my goal is to contribute my expertise to cutting-edge Machine Learning and NLP projects in a professional setting. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals and organizations, driving innovation and making a meaningful impact in the AI landscape.

## Projects

### Deploying Machine Learning API

- **Project:** [ML IMAGE GENERATION API WITH FASTAPI]
- **Description:** Developed an ML Image Generation API with FastAPI, seamlessly integrating a pre-trained model for stable diffusion, and implementing dynamic API endpoints for prompt-based image generation with automatic validation and documentation.
- **Repository:** [ML IMAGE GENERATION API WITH FASTAPI Repository]

### Text Summarization

- **Project:** [Automatic Text Summarization Using Transformers]
- **Description:** An NLP model that summarizes lengthy documents into concise, coherent summaries. It employs transformer architecture and has been evaluated for its effectiveness in reducing text length while preserving essential information.
